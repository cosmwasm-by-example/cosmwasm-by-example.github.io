Repository to contribute in: (abhinavmir/cosmwasm-by-example)[https://github.com/AbhinavMir/cosmwasm-by-example]

The website aims to be open source and quick to launch. We use [Hugo](https://gethugo.io) { is super easy to install! } to generate the website. The website is deployed via Vercel from the build repository. To see open issues, head over to [issues](https://github.com/AbhinavMir/cosmwasm-by-example/issues) and filter by tag. Refer to the template [here](./template). 

Here is how you contribute, clone the repository and create a file in `contents/post` with the following sections at minimum: `content.rs`, `msg.rs` and `state.rs` - throw in a README for better readability if you're feeling generous. Add in your content as needed.

Use `hugo server -D` to see if everything is as you like it. Once confirmed, you can [open a PR](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github). Other users can have a look and comment, but I should be able to review and merge a good PR within ~48 hours! 

You can also apply to be a collaborator via mail { abhinavmir@protonmail.com } - I'll get back to you ASAP! Feel free to add your Cosmos address at the bottom of your example for users to donate to you. 

See you around, Cosmonaut.
